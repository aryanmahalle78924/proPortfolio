        Born and brought up in San Francisco, California, I am an aquarian who
        just turned 13 years old. Just so you know, I am the crazy acquarian
        everyone warned you about. On one side, I love exploring different
        things. On the other side, I do have a serious goal of becoming an
        entreprenuer.
